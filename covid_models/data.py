        Args:
            iso: The country ISO code.
            npis: A list of non-pharmaceutical interventions to include in the
                feature vector for each day.
            exclude_weekly_average_below: The minimum weekly average COVID-19
                deaths for including in the time series. We assume the time
                series is too noisy below the minimum we specify. The default
                minimum is 1.0.
            max_date: If specified, data is truncated at `max_date`. This is
                useful if we want to do comparisons on future predictions.
            weeks_back: The number of weeks of non-pharmaceutical interventions
                (NPIs) that should be included in a feature vector. For every
                week before a day (i.e. last 1-7 days ago, 8-14 days ago, etc.)
                for every NPI, the average NPI for the week is a feature.
            global_bias: If true, the feature vector will include a bias
                component of "1".
            country_bias: If true, the feature vector will contain a "one hot"
                encoding of the country index. If it is true, both
                `country_index` and `total_countries` need to be set.
            country_index: The one-hot encoding index of the country, required
                for when `country_bias` is true.
            total_countries: The total number of countries, required for the
                length of the one-hot encoding of a country when `country_bias`
                is true.
            dynamic_bias: An instance of `AbstractDynamicBias`, which handles
                the processing of dynamic (recurrent) bias features (controls).
            alpha: A non-negative value which indicates how much the last day's
                non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are scaled to create
                a feature vector for future days. A value of 0.0 means that
                all NPIs are set to 0; a value of 1.0 means that NPIs continue
                as on the last day.
            future_days: The number of days in the future for which feature
                vectors will be created.

        Returns:
            x: A pandas Series, which contains the logarithm of the weekly
                average COVID-19 deaths as a time series. It is created so that
                there are no NaNs or negative infinite values in the time
                series. Small disconnected snippets early on in the time
                series, like when there is a single fatal COVID-19 case in a
                month, are trimmed. In cases where the original data was
                [NaN, a, NaN, b, c, d], the series [b, c, d] is returned.
            controls: A matrix of feature vectors. Each row contains a
                feature vector for the corresponding element in `x`.
            future_controls: A matrix of hypothesized future feature vectors.
            country_df: The data frame for country with ISO code `iso`.

        Remarks:
            The controls on day t-1 are intended to effect day t, and the
            dynamic bias term is constructed that way. It is intended to be
            used in a Gaussian Linear Dynamical System which has the form:
            z_t | z_{t-1}, u_{t-1} = ...
            y_t | z_t = ...
            where latent state z_t depends on the latent state z_{t-1} and
            the previous day's controls or features u_{t-1}. y_t is the
            observation on day t.
